# UWP Image Viewer
Images are grouped in three areas, pictures of dogs, cats and babies and in the design there are buttons corresponding to each of these folders.  When the user clicks to a menu button, the app should load the images (max 9 images) from the corresponding folder and present these images in the correct layout, this grid layout dependent on the image count.  When user clicks to an image, it goes fullscreen and menu goes in back state. This app should be built in UWP targeting a desktop environment.   

## Assessment criteria
- Quality and readability of the code.  Particular attention will be placed on how the candidate has approached the grid layout logic: how clean is this and easy would it be to modify/maintain (given a hypothetical client amend). 
- How closely has the design been matched.  E.g. Are the grids correct, has the grid spacing been considered, do the images scale correctly, are the buttons centered correctly, has any thought been given to how the UI reacts when the window is scaled.  This is important as the applications we create here generally have custom branded designs.
- Good use of MVVM: separation of business logic and UI
- Appropriate use of XAML and bindings. 
- Are the deliverables correct and does it build out-of-the-box.  

## Bonus points for (but not necessary):
Use of any animation (e.g simple XAML page transitions to demonstrate working knowledge) , XAML storyboards or UWP visual layer animations (optional) that would make it a nice user experience.
